# Hi, I'm Arnaud!

I'm an undergrad studying Math and CS at Carnegie Mellon University. In class I love writing mathematical proofs, in my free time I am a web developer who enjoys designing and writing frontend code. I also have been following the blockchain industry closely for the past two years and am excited for the web3.0 revolution!

Feel free to contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aavondet/">linkedin</a>, I'd love to talk!
